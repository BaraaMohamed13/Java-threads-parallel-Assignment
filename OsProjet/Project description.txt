Write a program to create a list with 9000000 elements and invokes a method named parallelAssignment to assign a random value to each element in this array. In addition, create a parallel method for each of the following:


	
	
sum the elements of the list in parallel
	
	
	
sort the elements of the list in parallel
	
	
	
find the minimum and maximum element in this list
	
Calculate the execution time of each method
